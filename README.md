OTP Based Cardless ATM Transactions Using Face Recognition


# OBJECTIVE:
The ultimate goal of this project is to provide account holders with secure ATM
transactions. The ATM takes a picture of the user's face and looks it up in the
bank's database as the first stage in authentication. The second level of
authentication generates an OTP for non-account holders. The remainder of the
transaction can only be completed by authorized users, and email is used to
communicate the transaction's specifics
